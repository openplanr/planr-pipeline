# SPEC-003 post-implementation security review

Date: 2026-07-29  
Scope: guided answers/actions, local sessions, evidence diagnostics and
classification, runtime adapters, provider boundaries.

## Result

**Passed — no unresolved critical or high severity finding.**

- Questions and actions originate from schema-validated CLI output.
- Answers use bounded stdin and canonical IDs; labels are not executable input.
- Mutations and provider calls require a separately selected, digest-bound
  action. Confirmation cannot be reused after project/config/head drift.
- Session files and evidence diagnostics are machine-local and mode `0600`.
- Diagnostics disclose category and safe location, never secret values.
- False-positive classifications are digest/head-bound; hard credential
  categories fail closed and cannot be overridden.
- Runtime capability downgrade never grants authority or provider access.
- Generated adapter assets are scanned for copied prompts, implicit `--yes`,
  direct journal edits, or runtime-specific model instructions.

Residual low risks are bounded: a local user with access to the same account can
read machine-local metadata, and soft-pattern classification is a deliberate
human governance action. Existing operating cache purge, ownership, audit event,
and project-head checks mitigate those risks.
