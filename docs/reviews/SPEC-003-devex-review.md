# SPEC-003 post-implementation DevEx review

Date: 2026-07-29  
Scope: guided Operating Board first use, runtime parity, recovery, automation.

## Result

**9.1/10 — release gate passed.**

| Dimension | Score | Evidence |
|---|---:|---|
| Getting started | 9.2 | `inspect` is credential-free; `init` owns the questionnaire and returns the next action. |
| CLI/API | 9.3 | Stable question IDs, typed envelopes, strict JSON, bounded stdin, exact action digests. |
| Errors/recovery | 9.1 | Structured initialization, session, capability, and value-free evidence recovery. |
| Documentation | 9.0 | Terminal/runtime, privacy, automation, and troubleshooting flows are explicit. |
| Environment/runtime | 9.1 | Native → chat → terminal → handoff downgrade is declared and tested. |
| Measurement | 8.9 | Seven golden journeys enforce the five-minute first-preview budget. |

No release-blocking DevEx finding remains. The runtime adapter is deliberately
thin: it does not hide CLI state transitions, infer consent, or continue after a
mutation/provider preview. The only external canaries deferred to CI are
credentialed real-runtime executions; deterministic PR fixtures cover the same
contract without provider variability.
