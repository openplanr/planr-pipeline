# OpenPlanr Ecosystem Release Checklist

Use this checklist for coordinated releases that touch protocol, docs, routing,
or marketplace metadata.

## Release Order

1. `planr-pipeline`
2. `OpenPlanr`
3. `skills`
4. `marketplace`

Patch releases can skip repos that do not need a content change, but the final
audit must still verify all four repos: `planr-pipeline`, `marketplace`,
`skills`, and `OpenPlanr`.

## Before Opening PRs

Run in `planr-pipeline`:

```bash
npm run doctor
npm run doctor -- --strict
npm run doctor -- --json
npm run ecosystem:conformance
npm run ecosystem:conformance -- --strict
npm run test:docs
npm test
npm run conformance:check
node --test tests/ecosystem/operate-release-contract.test.mjs
node --test tests/ecosystem/guided-operate-acceptance.test.mjs
node scripts/guided-operate-canary.mjs --fixtures
git diff --check
```

Run in `marketplace` when marketplace metadata or README rows change:

```bash
npm run generate
npm run check
git diff --check
```

Run in `skills` when skill routing or version claims change:

```bash
npm test
git diff --check
```

Run in `OpenPlanr` when CLI output or protocol references change:

```bash
npm test
npm run build
npm pack --dry-run
git diff --check
```

Do not stage local planning documents:

- `PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE.md`
- `FEATURE_MAP.md`
- `SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `DEVEX_QUALITY_RISK_REGISTER.md`

## Tag And Release Audit

After merge and tag creation, run:

```bash
npm run doctor -- --release --strict
npm run canary:operate-release
```

The release audit checks:

- `planr-pipeline` package, plugin manifest, stack metadata, protocol docs, and
  compatibility matrix agree.
- `marketplace` manifest and README agree.
- `skills` bundle has a version and the marketplace points to it.
- `marketplace/ecosystem.json` is generated from the released component and adapter versions.
- `OpenPlanr` has a package version and published release when checked.
- `CHANGELOG.md` carries a `## [<version>]` section for the version being
  released. A tag and a published release are not evidence that a version was
  documented — v0.37.0, v0.37.1, and v0.37.2 were tagged and published while the
  changelog jumped straight from 0.38.0 to 0.36.1.
- Git tags and GitHub releases exist for versioned repos.
- Cross-repo graph output matches through `npm run ecosystem:conformance -- --strict`.
- Operating Board is advertised only after the marketplace resolves Protocol
  v1.2, the exact `pipeline → CLI → skills → marketplace` promotion order,
  registry integrity for both npm packages, the final skills release, and a
  one-line installed `planr operate inspect --json` canary.
- Guided Operating Board adapters pass the native/chat/terminal/handoff parity
  fixtures, evidence recovery test, and five-minute first-preview budget.

## Rollback Notes

If a release is wrong, prefer a new patch release over retagging. Marketplace
metadata should point to the latest good released version. If a protocol doc is
wrong but schemas are correct, fix docs and ship a patch without changing the
protocol version.
