/**
 * Asserts CHANGELOG.md documents the version in package.json.
 *
 * Versions 0.37.0, 0.37.1 and 0.37.2 were tagged and published to npm with no
 * changelog section at all, and nothing detected it. This runs immediately
 * before `npm publish`, so a release cannot ship without its record.
 *
 * Deliberately standalone rather than part of the release audit: that audit
 * reconciles four repositories and needs them checked out, which a single-repo
 * publish job does not have. Wiring it here failed the publish with three
 * complaints about missing sibling repositories — a true report of a check that
 * did not belong in this context.
 *
 * Accepts both heading styles in use: `## 1.2.3` (changesets) and
 * `## [1.2.3] — date` (Keep a Changelog).
